# Computing Deviations

This package provides functions to compute various deviations between arrays in a variety of ways:

```@docs
counteq
countne
sqL2dist
L2dist
L1dist
Linfdist
gkldiv
meanad
maxad
msd
rmsd
psnr
```

!!! note

    All these functions are implemented in a reasonably efficient way without creating any
    temporary arrays in the middle.
